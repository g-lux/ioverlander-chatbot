We did find the Gold mine though - Cal Anderson Park, just off of Broadway and Pike Street - One of the places where Grunge Rock started. Cal Anderson park was nominated for some kind of \"wholesome award\" and was indeed a fantastic place to park for the night (in small Camper Van style -Not a place for big rigs). The pay parking ends at 20:00 and then it is free until 08:00 weekdays and weekends. It is located right beside the park itself which has a well lit Soccer field (lights out around 23:00), Tennis courts, basketball, a walking area, and is well used by Seattle-ites. There are some fantastic pubs like The Unicorn, or Nuemo's (Nirvana played there) a couple blocks away on Pike Street. The parking spots are Back in- Horizontal spots, so again- No Big rigs (Sorry). </p>\n",

You can camp more in the trees or more in a field. Field had 4G service. </p>\n",

Our RV could take all of the ruts easily but it took careful, slow, creative driving to get our little car with very little ground clearance through the ruts  to the camp site. Campsite is an fairly close but okay distance from the highway & train tracks since it was quite windy we couldn’t hear either of them. We would not have attempted getting to the site if it were muddy or with rain in the forecast because our truck would leave incredibly deep scars in the earth if it rained & our little car couldn’t have handed it.  It is in a dry lake bed & we would highly recommend avoiding it if it’s raining especially if you don’t have 4x4. If it is dry, with careful driving, we believe any camper, van or even passenger car could make it. It was exactly what we needed! </p>\n",

On the river side there are signs for \"No Parking between 8am-9:30am Mondays and Thursdays\" this is due to street cleaning but because free parking in Manhattan is rare everyone sits in their cars in their spots and if the cleaner comes (which sometimes it doesn't) everyone just moves temporarily as he passes and then goes back into their spots after. On the other side of the road it's the same deal but different days. I'd recommend arriving early to get a spot, I arrived at 8:30am on a Thursday and had no problems finding a spot straight away. Further to the north as the street goes from being Riverside Boulevard to Riverside Drive the cleaner times get later (9:30am-11am I believe) and which side of the street gets cleaned switches days. </p>\n",

The only caution with the forest road is that it is narrow with no shoulders and ditch drop off so there aren't very many places to yield for in coming traffic. The  day I was there (3 pm- 9 am) I did not see a single vehicle coming or going. You could occasionally hear traffic from US83 but it was very faint. Night was VERY quiet and pitch black. Very primitive with few fire rings and an information board..not water, no facilities, and call reception was very weak with AT&T. Campsite was large enough for multiple rigs. It is plenty big for a Class B or C or even a short tow behind. I would not try to take a Class A or 5th wheel in.</p>\n",

I’d take my 24’ Class C down that road if dry, but you will need pickup truck clearance for the later sites. Longer Class C might bottom out if you go too far.

We didn’t want to stay at the Shell at the junction and glad we didn’t since we found this. Backed in our 26’ class c with no issues but larger than that may be more visible. Recommend  parking at the lookout and walking down to scout the spot. </p>\n",

He directed us to the boat launch for Merritts Mill Pond off Hunter Fish Camp Road, west of Marianna, Florida. There’s a large parking lot where we stayed overnight. The parking was a tiny bit slanted but not bad. Big rigs could fit in but probably not advisable because boat trailers need room to park unless you come late and leave early. It was fantastic. The pond (about four or more miles long) has at least four springs coming into it so it’s crystal clear with cypress tree groves on each side. We went left and paddled up to Blue Springs Recreation Area at the end.</p>\n",

Dirt road was a little rough getting in, but no 4x4 needed (unless it just rained). Full AT&T and Verizon service. The first spot, right off the road would definitely fit a big rig (there was an RV parked there when I got here) but the dirt road that leads to more sites is washed out and narrow, so I doubt a big rig would be able to make it. </p>\n",

Away from any water source so bring plenty. ATT worked great. Had 2 bars and LTE, was able to watch a movie at night without any issues.

I highly recommend it but I wouldn't show up at dark because I'm guessing the few spots get taken up.

I do not recommend parking on this if it’s raining heavily or has rained recently. Toilets available, 20 minute walk away We’ve got a sprinter 170 and we did just fine, I’d be cautious for anything super big though as you may not be able to turn around down here Border patrol checked on us multiple times and never told us to leave or bothered us . Border patrol planes fly over here through the day when it’s not cloudy Update: stayed for a week and a half in the area, all but 2 nights here. I loved this place, got to meet some lovely nomads as well Check out “The Gym” in Del Rio if you need a good workout, they’re the only proper bodybuilding gym we’ve found since leaving our hometown.\n",

Much less road noise than the other ones that are off the side of I-80. A beautiful view of the stars right before the light pollution of Reno. However, this is directly along the train tracks, and a train does come through multiple times. It's not a long train, and better than hearing semis all night. There was a porta potty and hand wash station. Potty was locked though. Also, there's a sign pointing in the direction of the trailhead across the tracks, but another sign that says do not cross the tracks. I found it confusing and went over the tracks anyhow and that's clearly the trail. Pretty streams. </p>\n",

If you drive further down it is very quiet and peaceful, even right by the road was a nice spot. The road is packed gravel, not difficult to drive, most passenger cars should do fine.</p>\n",

About a dozen cars a day used the parking lot to access the nice trailheads down to the spillway (a cool short hike) and to the forest. That said, we were the only overnight campers and basically had it to ourselves most of the weekend. We almost parked at the boat ramp but a park employee said that was $40 and the dam was free overnight parking. We hiked and kayaked right from our spot. We would highly recommend, the only downside was no shade but great views, proper bathrooms, full 5G cell coverage, and lots of outdoor rec opportunities, lots to love!</p>\n",

Were very mindful with the tall grass and hot tailpipe. Beautiful spot. periodic road noise in the distance at our location, but there are many potential camping areas further in.

On the south side there are 2 or 3 spots that can accommodate a small to medium size trailer. Good exposure for solar; no obstructions for Starlink as long as you're not right next to one of the bigger trees. Surrounded by juniper trees and other desert plants. The entrance from Lovell Canyon Rd is fine, though if you cross the riverbed road to continue up South Broome, it's rather uneven and 4x4 and/or high clearance is recommended...though I did see a couple of little sedans simply send it up there lol.

In some spots, the road is more level than other spots. But there are a lot of free open parking spots, there’s a library parking lot, there’s a lot of spaces in this area.

I don't think RVs could get to it due to the entrance having posts on either side. But the parking lots are plenty large. I wasn't sure if my van would go through at first but it easily does.

It's not marked, but it is near the cattle grate through an open turn-off area. This site is called Cattle Grate because you can hear the cattle grate all the time when cars drive over it. Luckily, it's not too busy. We use brown noise at night, which works great. We have a 36 ft tt and did well getting in, but there are some deep ruts to be minful of driving back, but not too bad. It was also easy to get level. Wifi service is good; we have Starlink and AT&T.  Keep animals in at night due to the coyotes; you never see them during the day. There is hiking around the area and pretty clean. It can also get very dusty. </p>\n",

Yes, there is a big sign with rules that says no, but since we were November 9 and not in summertime, I presume they tolerate it. Pickups with noisy mufflers woke up us a few times, but when do we have the privilege of sleeping close anough to the beach to hear the waves and wake up with a beautiful sunrise, absolutely free?

The road is labeled Pollock Ranch Rd and/or Forest Service Rd 126.  The road is primarily used by hunters and extends through cattle pastures, national forest, tribal land and more.  There is a white posting near the entrance which requests you to log your vehicle and to respect the land.  You can go as far as you want to escape the noise of the highway, there are not a lot of turnouts but good spots can be found.  We went a few miles up the road before the fork in the road, it was super quiet and a nice spot.  Great views of the stars!  4WD not required, but be mindful of heavy mud in stormy conditions, you may end up being stuck if you are not prepared.</p>\n",

       "        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a dispersed camping site that overlooks the Elk River in Southeast Kansas. There are actually several level spots along the rutted two track road that parallels the bluff overlooking the river. Getting there can be tricky, because the final stretch of the road is barely visible. You will go along a regular gravel road that is a dead end, and then you will pass a sign that says “road not maintained, may end in water.” About 75 feet past that sign, it looks like the road is grassy and continues around to the left, but in fact, there is a fork that is much less visible, and goes to the right. I have cleaned up the overgrowth on the sides of the road to make it slightly more visible. Once you go down this road, the available sites are to the right, and the largest, most level one is first about 200 yards down the road. The sites are just beautiful. All of them allow you to pull your vehicle pretty much right up to the edge of the bluff overlooking the river, and you are unlikely to see anyone except people hiking the Elk River Trail, which also parallels the river. (That trail is about 50 feet lower in elevation than the site and is directly along the river.) You will get two bars of AT&T LTE. There is no water available at the site and no other amenities. I’ve attached a couple of pictures of my truck parked at the site.</p>\n",

You have to be careful and go slow and follow the path with the least amount of washboard otherwise it's going to shake everything loose in your rig. once you get into the national forest it's rocky and bumpy but it's not quite as bad. There's a little spots scattered beforehand but once you get back this far there are so many different camp spots tucked among the trees. Just about everyone has a stone fire ring and most spots are relatively level. There's a small creek that looks like it runs behind this area but at this time of year it's dry. So many deer out here. It's very entertaining. Great spot less than 20 minutes from the National monument which is fantastic. Big rigs can get in but just be careful where you pull into. might be worth walking into different spots before you pull in. The roads into the camp spots are a little bit rough in some spots but you can straddle. be aware you come through quite a few washes crossing the road on your way in, so need to be mindful if it's raining. Do not park in a wash. I saw several people parked in what looked like a runoff area and that is not good. zero cell service, but there is Wi-Fi available at the visitor center in the National monument. disappears to have been burned at one point, there are signs at the beginning of the forest. So be aware of tracking the black soot in on your shoes. It doesn't appear to be there but it's under layers of dirt.</p>\n",

There are security cameras. The garage is connected to the hotel but is also a normal public parking garage. You just have to find a spot that doesn't have a sign saying it's reserved for a specific purpose. I found one on a lower floor. I was car camping, and I just put up my windows covers and slept! I went in and out during the day by foot and nobody at the hotel seemed to mind. This was a great spot and would only be better if it was free! I paid like $25CAD for 12 hours which I didn't think was bad, especially because my car was very safe and warm. Oh, and apparently this garage does not have in and out privileges, meaning that once you park, you have to stay parked and if you leave you can't re-enter. but I didn't try that. </p>\n",
