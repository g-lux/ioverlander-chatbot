Cross the cattle guard a follow the gravel road, which is not very wide and it is covered by course gravel and rocks. 2WD should manage if going slowly and carefully. I don't think this drive is suitable for RVs.

I have opted for parking our camper van for a night on the wider part of the road as the plato was too windy and exposed.

I slept there in my van for 5 nights with no issues. On the river side there are signs for ""No Parking between 8am-9:30am Mondays and Thursdays"" this is due to street cleaning but because free parking in Manhattan is rare everyone sits in their cars in their spots and if the cleaner comes (which sometimes it doesn't) everyone just moves temporarily as he passes and then goes back into their spots after. On the other side of the road it's the same deal but different days. I'd recommend arriving early to get a spot, I arrived at 8:30am on a Thursday and had no problems finding a spot straight away. Further to the north as the street goes from being Riverside Boulevard to Riverside Drive the cleaner times get later (9:30am-11am I believe) and which side of the street gets cleaned switches days.

Pretty quiet with occasional road noise (not much though). 

The turn off is between mile marker 49 and 50. At the brown wooden sign you can go right or left. The left track is very rocky with lots of ruts - best for a high clearance 4WD. We only saw a few small turnouts that seemed mostly like a place to turn your vehicle around. 
The right track has many places to camp, and is more accessible with a 2WD vehicle. There are still some rocks and ruts further in, but as long as you take it slow it should be fine. RVs up to 30 feet can most likely fit - definitely the spots at the very entrance. 

Had 2 bars with T Mobile and 1 bar with Cricket. We didn’t see any animals but heard a lot of coyotes very close by.

"Coconino County, Arizona, United States",100 Mile Views,"Numerous dispersed national forest campsites along the Mogollon Rim with fantastic 100-mile views of the valley and mountain ranges beyond.  Requires semi-dry conditions, not accessible during winter.  (We were there in late March and it’s 2WD with normal passenger vehicle clearance, Class B/C RV accessible.)

Take Young Highway south from Highway 260, then take the 3rd dirt road right.  There is a sign for FR campsites - the area is undeveloped camping. The first hundred feet have some larger puddles if there has been any rain, but the ground is firm and rocky underneath, any passenger vehicle, trailer, or Class B/C RV can get through unless the whole road is muddy.  Dirt road beyond the initial large dispersed camping area is mostly smooth but hazardous when muddy.

Go past the very large area for dispersed camping surrounded by forest - this is your last resort if other sites are taken.  The first option with views will be on your left about 1/4 mile down; look for the large pile of rocks for the fire ring.  This spot has merely ‘terrific’ views and is accessible to 2WD in semidry conditions.  We stopped here in our 24’ Class C due to the mud puddles beyond.

The sites with 100-mile views start about 1/8 mile further, on the left past the 3 large mud puddles (if there has been any rain).  I saw at least 4 sites.  The first is a left turn 4WD road for the last 50 feet.  The 2nd-4th are more easily seen because of the rock-pile fire rings. Some are accessible to 2WD if it’s dry.  I’d take my 24’ Class C down that road if dry, but you will need pickup truck clearance for the later sites. Longer Class C might bottom out if you go too far.  The road appears to continue down the escarpment - but we didn’t go that far.  

Nice place to hike.

This spot is on a knoll overlooking ""Near Valley of Fire State Park.""  It is not very level but people did stay on it while we were at ""Near Valley of Fire State Park.""

It is rocky, steep, with loose dirt and off-canter.  But clearly it is doable.  If you are over 40' long, you may struggle with this spot.

I would recommend 4wd and if you are pulling a trailer, I would say 4wd is probably needed to get up to it.  There isn't a lot of room to turn around at the top either.  We looked at this spot before choosing the lower spot simply because we were pulling a trailer and maneuvering on this knoll was going to be more difficult than the big turn around below at ""Near Valley of Fire State Park.""",36.4128,-114.61707,2.0

The road is visible from the campsite, but traffic was very minimal after dark.

With Starlink, we received 130mbps down and 3.5mbps up. Verizon signal on the phone was 5 bars. AT&T signal was 5 bars with our cell antenna.
(Speed update, 3/25/2023- Starlink was 30 Mbps down, 4-5 Mbps up; AT&T was 10-12 Mbps down, 1-2  Mbps up.)

FYI about the spot just to the east (where the water crosses the road), there's construction currently going on down there and the grade makes it near impossible to get into that spot. There's about a 6' sloped drop-off. It would be impossible for our big rig. Maybe a small camper van?? We can almost see that spot from where we are, but there's a hill in the way which does make it secluded.

"De Baca County, New Mexico, United States",Bosque Redondo Riverside,"I wanted to add this place separate from the Bosque Redondo Lake Park listed nearby. This area is a bit rougher to get too and has even fewer amenities than the park. But you can camp right near the river & have a bit more privacy.

There are many campsites on this side of the park. I suggest using Google maps satellite to view the ""roads."" AWD/4WD is necessary after heavy rains, but 2wd won't be a problem most of the time. You need a bit of clearance but not a ton; a Subaru will make it ezpz, a Camry may not.

Caution: if you put these GPS coords into Google maps, it may take you to the wrong side of the river. Now, if your rig is built enough, you can certainly make it across the very shallow Pecos. But for the rest of us, find this campsite by navigating to the Bosque Redondo Lake Park nearby & just picking a track that leads toward the river.

We camped here for a week no prob. Plenty of sites with shade, a few with full sun. Poor, but usable, at&t. Lots of sky for starlink.

The night sky is fantastic. Fort Sumner is small, so you don't get too much light pollution. There is a grocery store, laundromat, pot shop, liquor store, gift shop, and a few restaurants in town.

I highly recommend visiting the Bosque Redondo memorial nearby. Billy the Kid's grave is there too, and a museum downtown.

There's a good amount of trash. Based on that, this area could become a party zone on a popular weekend. Locals definitely use the area to fish. Looks like a good swimming hole, too. It's quiet in December.

"Elk River Hiking Trail, Crane, Montgomery County, Kansas, 67344, United States",Elk River Overlook,"This is a dispersed camping site that overlooks the Elk River in Southeast Kansas. There are actually several level spots along the rutted two track road that parallels the bluff overlooking the river. Getting there can be tricky, because the final stretch of the road is barely visible. You will go along a regular gravel road that is a dead end, and then you will pass a sign that says “road not maintained, may end in water.” About 75 feet past that sign, it looks like the road is grassy and continues around to the left, but in fact, there is a fork that is much less visible, and goes to the right. I have cleaned up the overgrowth on the sides of the road to make it slightly more visible. Once you go down this road, the available sites are to the right, and the largest, most level one is first about 200 yards down the road. The sites are just beautiful. All of them allow you to pull your vehicle pretty much right up to the edge of the bluff overlooking the river, and you are unlikely to see anyone except people hiking the Elk River Trail, which also parallels the river. (That trail is about 50 feet lower in elevation than the site and is directly along the river.) You will get two bars of AT&T LTE. There is no water available at the site and no other amenities.

There's a little spots scattered beforehand but once you get back this far there are so many different camp spots tucked among the trees. Just about everyone has a stone fire ring and most spots are relatively level. There's a small creek that looks like it runs behind this area but at this time of year it's dry. So many deer out here. It's very entertaining. Great spot less than 20 minutes from the National monument which is fantastic. Big rigs can get in but just be careful where you pull into. might be worth walking into different spots before you pull in. The roads into the camp spots are a little bit rough in some spots but you can straddle. be aware you come through quite a few washes crossing the road on your way in, so need to be mindful if it's raining.
