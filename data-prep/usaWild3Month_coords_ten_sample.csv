"Old US 93, Mohave County, Arizona, United States",Old US93,"
Turn-of from Hwy93 (going North / 35.915726, -114.629417) to ""Old US93"". 
Cross the cattle guard a follow the gravel road, which is not very wide and it is covered by course gravel and rocks. 2WD should manage if going slowly and carefully. I don't think this drive is suitable for RVs. 

After approximately 0.9mile / 1.4km you will come to wider section of the road with very short ""driveway"" branching to the right, leading to a plato overlooking the valley. 

According to a map I have available, this spot seems to be right on the border line between Lake Mead National Recreation Area and BLM. 

I have opted for parking our camper van for a night on the wider part of the road as the plato was too windy and exposed.

* No Services

Hidden from the view from Hwy93, however you can still hear some noise from the road muffled by the distance and the elevation difference. 

I did stay one night, while in transit and in a need of decent sleep & quick access to/from Hwy93. All was good, no problems.

"Ridge Park Road, Newport Coast, Newport Beach, Orange County, CAL Fire Southern Region, California, 92657, United States",Ridge Park Rd,"This road goes to a park and to a trailhead. It’s free parking with no “no overnight parking” or street cleaning signs. A vanlife local let us know about it. It seems to be a common overnight spot and we weren’t hassled. There is a sign recommending to keep your vehicle locked and belongings secure, probably smash-and-grab style theft. The area felt safe and is very beautiful. Highly recommend! It’s up on a hilltop with great views.

Heavily trafficked with hikers starting early morning (5-6 am) especially on weekends. ",33.605731,-117.802708,308.0,
"Old Las Vegas Highway, Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States",Frontage Rd -Canoncito,"Dirt pullout on frontage road across from a church. Surface is firm. Good for stealth. There is a highway retaining wall and the pullout is lower elevation than the highway so the highway noise is not bad since it is above you. The frontage road dead ends at Navajo land, and not a single car passed the pullout on the frontage road so it’s quiet. There are some houses in area but not adjacent to the pullout. Enough room for a couple vans or truck+trailer. 
I arrived at 7p and left at 7a.
